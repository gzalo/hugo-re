# Hugo-RE
Relive the Hugo TV gaming experience from the 90s!

Using an IP phone (or an analog phone with a FXS gateway) you'll be able to call the virtual Hugo hotline and play the games virtually.
Eventually we'll have some AI-generated voices for Hugo and the host (Gaby in Argentina)

**Phase 0**: As seen in Flashparty 2023, with quite a high latency due to the audio processing chain

**Phase 1**: As seen in Cybercirujas federal event 2023, way lower latency and quite playable
